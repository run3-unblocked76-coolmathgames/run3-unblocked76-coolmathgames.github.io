        <h2>Mastering Run 3 Run Game: Essential Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Jump Timing: Press the Spacebar or Up Arrow as you approach a gap to ensure your jump covers the distance. It’s crucial to judge the track spacing in advance.</li>
            <li>Wall Rotation: When the path is narrow or blocked, try moving close to the wall to trigger rotation and change your direction using gravity. Be sure to adjust the direction keys promptly to maintain balance.</li>
            <li>Avoid Speeding: Going too fast may prevent you from reacting to sudden track changes. It’s better to control your pace and slow down when precise jumps are required.</li>
            <li>Memorize Obstacle Positions: For levels where you repeatedly fail, take note of the obstacle patterns, find a safe route, and practice repeatedly to pass through.</li>
            <li>Focus the Screen: Keep your focus within the next three tiles ahead, anticipate upcoming jumps or turns, and avoid being distracted by unexpected obstacles.</li>
            <li>Unlock Items and Characters: Complete high-score challenges to unlock characters with special abilities like flying or slowing down. Choose the right character for tougher levels.</li>
            <li>Use the Pause Function: When facing rapidly changing paths, press the P key to pause the game, carefully observe the layout, and resume when ready.</li>
            <li>Try Different Paths: Some tracks have hidden routes. Deviate from the main path and you may find shortcuts that make it easier to complete levels.</li>
            <li>Stay Calm: Mistakes are inevitable, but patience is key. Take breaks when needed and return refreshed to tackle difficult levels.</li>
